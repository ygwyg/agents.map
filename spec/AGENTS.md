# Spec — AGENTS.md

The AGENTS.map specification.

## Current version

- `v1.md` — The v1 spec. Status: Draft.

## Conventions

- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) for normative requirements.
- Keep examples minimal and copy-pasteable.
- The spec must be readable as standalone Markdown — no external dependencies.
- Section numbering is stable. New sections append; don't renumber existing ones.

## Change process

- Propose changes via GitHub issues or discussions first.
- Breaking changes require a new version file (`v2.md`).
- Non-breaking additions (new optional fields, clarifications) can amend the current version.
